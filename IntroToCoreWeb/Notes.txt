1) .NET core web app runs on any OS
2) They use dependency injection to work with http pipeline.
3) Request/Response available
4) Dependency injection used here is mostly contructor based.

-----------------------------------
1) Main method---> Is in Program.cs
2) main calls--- createHostBuilder() which calls StartUp Class
3) Start Up class has constructor dependency injection implemented 
using IConfiguration, it uses property for reading the data from the 
appsettings.Development.json
4) Configure and Configure Services-- these two methods are used to work 
with http pipeline and so they are responsible for configuring any services
required by the web app
ConfigureServices method is used for registering the service
whereas 
Configure method is used for configuration of the registered service 
with the app

ConfigureServices--- USed to add services to the container--(Add)
Configure---- configuring the http pipeline(Use)

Middleware-----> components are added as per the project requirement,
if sesssion is required --- AddSession() and then we can UseSession();
------------------------------------------------
Request---> Kestrel(Internal Web Server)

request-->IIS---->Kestrel--->runs the app.
---------------------------------------------------

differences
asp.net mvc(.net framework)----> IIS--- >Windows OS
asp.net(.net Framework)-----> IIS----->Windows OS
----------------------------
work across platforms(across OS)---- 
.NET Core--Linux,Unix.
Alsos works on Mac,Android(.net standard library)  using Xamarian tools

Kestrel server-----> response
IIS--->Kestrel----
*********************************
1) framework will only for windows and core will work for any os
2)json instead of xml
3) Dependency Injection not there by default in framework
4) instead of references  we use nuget package manager, Middlewares
5) core is open source and cross platform whereas framework is not
6) many ides are available
7) web app,mobile and windows store apps, these not available in framework
8) core has support for microservices and framework has support only till webapi.
Webapi can call a micro services.
9) Core has CLI(Command Line Interface) support, framework doesn't have it.
--------------------------------------------------
.NET Core SDK(Software Developement Kit)
CLI ---- create and work with apps.
open cmd--> type dotnet

dotnet(drivername)
commands:
dotnet  <command> <arguments> <options>
